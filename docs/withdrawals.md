# Merchant Withdrawals

Merchants can withdraw their accumulated balance from the Subscription Vault using
`withdraw_merchant_funds` for the default token bucket or
`withdraw_merchant_token_funds` for a specific accepted token bucket.
Funds accumulate to a merchant's balance each time a subscription for that merchant is
successfully charged.

The merchant earnings ledger is stored persistently as `MerchantBalance[(merchant, token)]`
and only the authorized merchant may withdraw from their own bucket.

## Process and Requirements

1. **Authorization**: The merchant must authorize the withdrawal transaction. The contract enforces this using `merchant.require_auth()`.
2. **Valid Amounts**: The `amount` to withdraw must be strictly positive (`> 0`). An attempt to withdraw `0` or a negative amount will result in `Error::InvalidAmount` (`405`).
3. **No Overdrafts**: A merchant cannot withdraw more than their currently accumulated balance. Overdraft attempts are rejected with `Error::InsufficientBalance` (`1003`).
4. **Zero Balance**: If a merchant has no recorded accumulated balance in the requested bucket
   (e.g., no subscriptions have been charged yet), withdrawal attempts will return
   `Error::NotFound` (`404`).
5. **Vault Solvency Check**: Before transfer, the contract verifies that its custody balance for
   the selected token is at least the requested withdrawal amount. If not, the withdrawal is
   rejected with `Error::InsufficientBalance` (`1003`) and the ledger is left unchanged.
6. **Token Isolation**: Merchant balances are stored per `(merchant, token)` bucket, so
   withdrawing one token never debits another token's earnings.

## Earnings Ledger Update

Every successful withdrawal also increments `TokenEarnings.withdrawals` by the withdrawn amount
in the same storage write. This keeps the reconciliation invariant:

```
MerchantBalance = accruals.total − withdrawals − refunds
```

true at all times. The `get_reconciliation_snapshot(merchant)` entrypoint returns a
`TokenReconciliationSnapshot` per token where `computed_balance` must always equal
`get_merchant_balance_by_token(merchant, token)`. Any divergence is a data integrity violation.

## Event Topic

The withdrawal event is published with topic `("withdrawn", merchant, token)` — three elements.
The token address in position 2 allows indexers to efficiently filter withdrawal events for a
specific token without decoding the full event payload.

## Security Guarantees

- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: The contract validates balances first, persists the debited
  merchant bucket, updates `TokenEarnings.withdrawals`, decrements `TotalAccounted`, emits the
  withdrawal event, and only then performs the token transfer. If the external transfer fails,
  the invocation aborts atomically and storage rolls back.
- **Arithmetic Safety**: Internal checks comprehensively prevent overflows using checked
  arithmetic (`checked_add`, `checked_sub`).
- **No Side Effects**: A failed withdrawal (due to overdraft or mismatched auth) has no
  side-effects on the ledger state, earnings record, or other subscriptions.
- **Blocklist guard**: A merchant address on the blocklist cannot call withdrawal functions.
  Accumulated earnings are preserved until an admin removes the block.

## Interaction Flow
1. An admin charges a subscription using `charge_subscription`.
2. The `SubscriptionVault` increments the `merchant_balance` by the subscription's `amount`.
3. The merchant triggers `withdraw_merchant_funds` or `withdraw_merchant_token_funds`
   specifying the token bucket and amount to withdraw.
4. The contract debits only that merchant/token bucket and emits a withdrawal event with the
   token, amount, and remaining balance.
5. The requested token amount is transferred to the merchant's Stellar account.
