# Event Indexer Compatibility Fixtures

This repository includes a dedicated fixture pack to ensure all smart contract events maintain stable, predictable payloads for downstream indexers and analytics pipelines.

## Fixture Catalog

The following fixtures are located in `contracts/subscription_vault/src/test_indexer_fixtures.rs`. Each test is prefixed with `fixture_` and exercises a specific lifecycle or event scenario.

| Test Name                                    | Description                                                               | Key Events                                         |

| `fixture_lifetime_cap_reached`               | Subscription reaches its lifetime charge cap and auto-cancels.            | `lifetime_cap_reached`, `subscription_cancelled`   |
| `fixture_grace_period_to_active_recovery`    | Recovery flow from GracePeriod back to Active after a deposit.            | `funds_deposited`, `subscription_resumed`          |

## Running the Fixtures

To validate the current canonical event sequences or regenerate snapshots:

```bash
cargo test fixture_ -- --nocapture
```

Snapshots are stored under:
`contracts/subscription_vault/test_snapshots/test/`

## Event Schemas & Indexing

All events follow the `soroban-sdk` event pattern. Indexers should listen for the following topics:

- `funds_deposited`: `(Symbol::new(env, "funds_deposited"), subscription_id)`
- `subscription_charged`: `(Symbol::new(env, "subscription_charged"), subscription_id)`
- `subscription_charge_failed`: `(Symbol::new(env, "subscription_charge_failed"), subscription_id)`
- `subscription_cancelled`: `(Symbol::new(env, "subscription_cancelled"), subscription_id)`
- `merchant_withdrawal`: `(Symbol::new(env, "merchant_withdrawal"), merchant_address)`
- `one_off_charged`: `(Symbol::new(env, "one_off_charged"), subscription_id)`

## Security Assumptions

1. **Deterministic Behavior**: All fixtures use controlled environment timestamps (`test_env.jump`) to ensure stable event ordering.
2. **Privacy**: Events include `subscription_id` and `amount` but avoid leaking sensitive metadata keys unless explicitly indexed.
3. **Negative Cases**: Fixtures like `fixture_unauthorized_charge_rejected` ensure that no state is mutated and no valid events are emitted for failed authorization.

## Indexer Fast-Forward Rules

To accelerate indexer bootstrap for long-lived contracts the admin can publish
compact balance snapshots that anchor a merchant/token pair to a single ledger.

- Use the admin entrypoint `emit_merchant_balance_snapshot(admin, merchant, token)`
  to publish a single `MerchantBalanceSnapshotEvent` for the given pair.
- For bulk bootstrap, call `emit_all_balances_snapshot(admin, start_id, limit)` which
  scans subscriptions in `[start_id, start_id+limit)` and emits one snapshot per
  unique `(merchant, token)` discovered in that window. Chain pages until no
  more snapshots are returned.
- After applying a snapshot for `(merchant, token)` with `ledger_sequence = L`,
  indexers can fast-forward by skipping historical events up to and including
  ledger `L` and resume streaming from `L + 1`.

Security note: only the stored admin may call these entrypoints. Snapshots are
intended as indexing aids and do not change accounting invariants on-chain.
